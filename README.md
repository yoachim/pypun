Generate pun names

want to sift through a bunch of common phrases and automatically find amusing phrases like "Taco Time Cop", and "heavy petting zoo".


Grabbed wikipedia article titles from:

http://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/enwiki-latest-all-titles-in-ns0.gz

Plans for the future:

* Make pip installable
* deploy a twitter bot that tweets three-word phrase puns
